# Horcrux

Horcrux is header-only C++ library which uses M.O. Rabin's Information Dispersal
Algorithm to split a block of bytes into *n* pieces, such that the block can be
recovered from any subset of *m* pieces.

<strong>This is not cryptographic software.</strong>

It does not enable users to gain "information security" as specified in local
and international export and import laws for dual-purpose materials and
technologies.
